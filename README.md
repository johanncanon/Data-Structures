## Introduction

This project is designed to help you understand how to use different data structures in Java and how to manipulate them effectively. Additionally, it provides examples of how to integrate a Spring Boot application with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.

## Data Structures in Java

Java provides a rich set of data structures that can be used to store and manipulate collections of data. Some of the most commonly used data structures include:

- **Arrays**: Fixed-size data structures that store elements of the same type.
- **ArrayList**: A resizable array that implements the List interface.
- **LinkedList**: A doubly-linked list implementation of the List interface.
- **HashSet**: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
- **HashMap**: A collection that stores key-value pairs and allows fast retrieval.

## Manipulating Data Structures

Here are some common operations you can perform on data structures in Java:

### Arrays

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println(numbers[2]); // Output: 3
